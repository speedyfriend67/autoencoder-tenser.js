# Autoencoder Visualizer

Autoencoder Visualizer is a web-based tool that allows users to visualize and train autoencoder models using TensorFlow.js. Autoencoders are a type of neural network used for unsupervised learning, particularly for dimensionality reduction and feature learning.

## Features

- Input 5 numbers separated by commas for visualization.
- Configure model parameters such as encoding units, epochs, learning rate, optimizer, loss metric, regularization, dropout rate, early stopping, learning rate scheduler, and batch normalization.
- Visualize the training process with loss charts.
- Display the encoded and decoded representations of input data.
- View model summary.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository.
2. Open `index.html` in a web browser.
3. Enter 5 numbers separated by commas.
4. Configure model parameters as desired.
5. Click the "Visualize" button to train and visualize the autoencoder model.
6. View the training process, loss charts, encoded and decoded representations, and model summary.

## Technologies

- TensorFlow.js: A JavaScript library for training and deploying machine learning models in the browser and on Node.js.
- Chart.js: A JavaScript library for creating charts and graphs.
